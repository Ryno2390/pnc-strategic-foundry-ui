Amazon is a well-established company, but we need to confirm it meets the Investment Grade requirement (BBB- or better by S&P/Fitch, Baa3 by Moody's). Assuming they meet this, we pass this requirement.\n    *   **Merchant Revenue:**  Implicitly compliant. The loan request doesn't mention any merchant revenue, so we assume it is 0%, well below the 20% threshold.\n\n2.  **Technology & LTV:**\n    *   **Technology Tier:** Solar is considered Tier 1 (Proven). Sodium-Ion batteries will need to be evaluated but would likely fall under Tier 2, Emerging. We need to determine which technology this loan is focused on and which one will be used to determine the LTV.\n    *   **Tier 1 (Solar) LTV Limit:** 80% max.\n    *   **Tier 2 (Sodium-Ion Batteries) LTV Limit:** 50% max AND requires Manufacturer's Warranty Insurance.\n    *   **Requested LTV:** 75%. This is compliant *if* the loan is considered a Solar loan and if Amazon's credit rating is investment grade. Otherwise, we need more information.\n\n3.  **Interconnection:**\n    *   We need to see the Interconnection Service Agreement.\n\n4.  **Environmental:**\n    *   Clean Phase I ESA: Verify this is included in the final documents.\n    *   Wetlands: We need to verify if there is any construction being done in any wetlands.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nFLAGGED.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe loan request is conditionally approved, requiring the following information:\n\n*   **Amazon's Credit Rating Verification:** Absolutely critical to ensure compliance with PPA off-taker requirements.\n*   **Interconnection Service Agreement:** This is required.\n*   **Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment:** Verify this has been done and is clean.\n*   **Wetland Impacts:** Determine if the construction impacts any wetlands.\n*   **Clarification on Technology Focus:**  We need to determine if the primary focus of the loan is on the solar field or the battery storage. The decision on the primary focus will then determine the maximum LTV permissible, as this impacts whether or not the loan requires insurance to be approved.\n\nUntil we have this information, we cannot make a final decision.\n", "response_hash": "cae93ee4b867861ad4520a9891b90b8fc75260e31af1102aaa7acdd97e9d077a", "metadata": {"source": "api_v1", "fairness_flagged": false}, "previous_hash": "GENESIS", "record_hash": "db2fb1d5a4ff91213294965491ba4ce747efbb3cbf0f9b714c13422e2b045560"}
