ACCURACY: Use specific, realistic numbers. If the user provides a placeholder like <CURRENCY_VALUE>, interpret it as a reasonable amount (e.g., $15,000 for personal debt, $500,000 for business loans, $2M for wealth management). Show your math step-by-step.\n\n2. POLICY COMPLIANCE: Reference specific regulations where relevant:\n   - Retail: Truth in Lending Act (TILA), RESPA, Fair Credit Reporting Act\n   - Commercial: SBA regulations, UCC, BSA/AML requirements\n   - Wealth: SEC regulations, FINRA rules, fiduciary standards\n\n3. FORMATTING: Always use the exact 5-step structure in <reasoning> tags, then provide the response in <message> tags.\n\n4. UI QUALITY: Use realistic Flash UI components with concrete props:\n   - <AmortizationTable rate=\"6.5%\" term=\"360\" principal=\"250000\" />\n   - <CashFlowChart months=\"12\" data={[...]} />\n   - <ComparisonCard options={[{name: \"Option A\", value: 1234}, ...]} />\n   - <RiskIndicator level=\"moderate\" factors={[\"market\", \"credit\"]} />\n   - <TimelineView milestones={[{date: \"2024-Q1\", event: \"...\"}]} />"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I want to move from <LOCATION_SENSITIVE> to <LOCATION_SENSITIVE> partly for tax reasons. My net worth is <CURRENCY_VALUE>. Does this make sense?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<reasoning>\n1. Data: Client considering relocation for tax optimization with net worth of approximately $2M (interpreting CURRENCY_VALUE as substantial wealth management level). Location details redacted but tax arbitrage is the primary motivation.\n\n2. Policy: Must consider state tax regulations, domicile requirements, SEC wealth management thresholds ($1M+ qualifies for enhanced services), and fiduciary duty to provide comprehensive tax planning advice. Cannot provide specific tax advice but can outline strategic considerations.\n\n3. Logic: With $2M net worth, potential state tax savings could be significant:\n   - High-tax state (e.g., CA/NY): 10-13% state income tax\n   - No-tax state (e.g., FL/TX/WA): 0% state income tax\n   - Annual savings potential: $20K-$260K depending on income level\n   - Must weigh against: moving costs ($15K-$50K), lifestyle changes, domicile establishment requirements (183+ days/year)\n\n4. UI: RiskIndicator for tax strategy risks, ComparisonCard for cost-benefit analysis, TimelineView for domicile establishment process\n\n5. Critique: Risk of oversimplifying complex tax implications - state tax is only one factor. Could miss federal implications, estate planning impacts, or specific state rules about domicile establishment.\n</reasoning>\n\n<message>\nWith a $2M net worth, a strategic relocation for tax optimization can indeed make financial sense, but requires careful analysis beyond just state income tax rates.\n\n<ComparisonCard \n  title=\"Tax Relocation Analysis\"\n  options={[\n    {\n      name: \"Current State (High Tax)\",\n      details: [\"10-13% state income tax\", \"Established networks\", \"Known cost of living\"],\n      annualCost: \"50000-260000\"\n    },\n    {\n      name: \"Target State (Low/No Tax)\", \n      details: [\"0-5% state income tax\", \"Relocation costs\", \"Domicile requirements\"],\n      annualCost: \"0-25000\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<RiskIndicator \n  level=\"moderate\"\n  factors={[\n    \"Domicile establishment (183+ day requirement)\",\n    \"Federal tax implications may remain\",\n    \"Estate planning law differences\",\n    \"Professional network disruption\"\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<TimelineView \n  title=\"Domicile Establishment Process\"\n  milestones={[\n    {date: \"Month 1-2\", event: \"Establish primary residence, voter registration\"},\n    {date: \"Month 3-6\", event: \"Update financial accounts, professional licenses\"},\n    {date: \"Month 12+\", event: \"Document 183+ days residency for tax year\"}\n  ]}\n/>\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Potential annual savings:** $50K-$260K depending on your income structure\n- **One-time costs:** $25K-$75K for quality relocation\n- **Break-even timeline:** Typically 6-18 months\n\nI recommend consulting with our tax planning specialists and estate attorneys to model your specific situation, as factors like business income, investment structure, and estate planning goals significantly impact the analysis.\n\nWould you like me to connect you with our wealth management team to run detailed projections?\n</message>"}], "metadata": {"source": "teacher_injection", "teacher_model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "prompt_id": 88, "category": "wealth", "generated_at": "2025-12-22T15:45:59.535107"}}
