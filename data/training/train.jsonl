This requires an estate planning attorney.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. How important is financial aid for these grandchildren?\n2. What's your overall estate plan? (May affect GST planning)\n3. Do you want the funds strictly for education or broader use?\n\nShall I connect you with our trust and estate planning team for a comprehensive review?\n</message>"}]}

This hybrid approach gives you:\n- Significant tax benefit on donated items\n- Continued enjoyment of retained pieces\n\n**Critical Next Steps:**\n1. Confirm the step-up in basis (inheriting means your basis = FMV at death)\n2. Get a qualified appraisal (required for any charitable strategy)\n3. Consult a tax attorney (this area is complex and penalties are severe)\n\nWould you like me to connect you with our philanthropic planning team to explore these options in detail?\n</message>"}]}

This is often the optimal approach.\n\n**Critical Information Needed:**\n1. What's your expected income in retirement?\n2. At what age do you plan to retire?\n3. Do you have non-retirement funds to pay the conversion tax?\n4. Do you have heirs who would inherit these accounts?\n\nShall I model specific conversion scenarios once I have these details?\n</message>"}]}
