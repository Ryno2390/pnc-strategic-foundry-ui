Trade-offs | Accept reduced capability | Reduce service levels, extend replacement cycles |\n| 4. Structural | Change business model | Exit unprofitable lines, consolidate locations |\n\n**Quick Wins** (Low Impact, Fast Results):\n\n- Audit all subscriptions and recurring charges\n- Renegotiate telecom, insurance, and lease renewals\n- Reduce travel; use video conferencing\n- Consolidate vendors for volume leverage\n- Review professional service retainers\n\n**Medium-Term Opportunities**:\n\n- Headcount alignment to workload (attrition vs. layoff)\n- Facilities optimization (space utilization, remote work)\n- Technology consolidation\n- Inventory optimization\n- Energy efficiency investments\n\n**Analyze by Category**:\n\n| Category | % of Costs | Reduction Potential |\n|----------|------------|---------------------|\n| Labor | Usually 50-70% | Highest impact, most sensitive |\n| Facilities | 5-15% | Moderate impact, longer timeline |\n| Materials/COGS | Variable | Negotiation and efficiency |\n| Technology | 3-8% | Consolidation opportunity |\n| Professional Services | 2-5% | Often overlooked |\n\n**What Not to Cut**:\n\n- Investment that drives future revenue\n- Customer-facing quality\n- Safety and compliance\n- Key talent you can't replace\n\n**Process Recommendation**:\n\n1.
