Fine-tuning a model like Llama 3.1 as a Risk Management professional requires a structured, "safety-first" approach. You aren't just teaching it to talk; you are teaching it to think within the "Brilliantly Boring" guardrails of PNC.

1. The Strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

For your specific role, I recommend Instruction Fine-Tuning. This involves feeding the model examples of "Input" (a CEO’s question) and "Output" (the ideal, responsible advisor response).

Precision Over Creativity: Focus on high-quality, curated data pairs rather than sheer volume.

The "Responsible" Guardrail: Include examples where the model identifies it doesn't have enough data and politely declines to speculate—a key trait of being "responsible since 1865".

2. The Tech Stack: Use PEFT and LoRA

You don't need to retrain all 8 billion parameters. Use Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with a technique called LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).

Efficiency: This only updates a tiny fraction of the model, making it faster and cheaper to run on internal PNC hardware.

Stability: It prevents "catastrophic forgetting," ensuring the model keeps its foundational logic while learning the PNC-specific "Brilliantly Boring" tone.

3. Data Preparation: The "Boring" Dataset

Your dataset should be a reflection of the Strategic Foundry’s high standards.

Tone of Voice: Ensure all response examples use the steady, professional language found in the PNC Brand Regular typography guidelines.

Formatting: Teach the model to output summaries that fit Neulis Sans Bold headlines—concise, authoritative, and clear.

Visual Structure: Use the shapes and patterns from the brand overview to describe how the AI should suggest data be displayed (e.g., "Display this risk alert in a rectangular orange call-out box").

4. Step-by-Step Execution

Environment Setup: Use a library like Hugging Face’s trl or unsloth for the fastest fine-tuning speeds.

Define the System Prompt: Hard-code the "Strategic Advisor" persona into the training so the model always knows it is representing PNC Bank.

Run the Training: Monitor the "loss curve." You want it to go down steadily, indicating the model is successfully adopting the Dark Grey level of professional sobriety.

The Risk Audit: As a Risk Manager, your final step is a "red-team" test. Try to make the model give irresponsible advice; if it refuses, you’ve succeeded.

Actionable Advice

Start with a "Synthetic Dataset." Use an existing LLM to generate 100 high-quality variations of PNC-style advisor responses based on the PNCBrandElementsOverview.pdf, then manually review and edit them before feeding them to Llama 3.1. This ensures the training data is perfectly on-brand from day one.
